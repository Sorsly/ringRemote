!!general

*may need to move pushbuttons to atbtlc because I need 2 pins
**either hw pins 11&12 or 19&20
***move the HMI stuff to any of the LP_GPIO pins
**only need to program max32660 because atbtlc has no flash (treat as a slave device)
**


!!power

*add battery supervisor
**according to graph on datasheet of chosen battery (ML-621S), full capacity is exhausted at ~2.25V. choosing supervisor based on this.
**nanopower line of supervisors from maxim: 23 suffix is ideal (2.313V nom)
***actually, expensive. found a cheaper one thats smaller too, slightly more
power. tps3839g25

*likely create a battery charge circuit as a separate device (save package
space, should be rarely used if battery life is good)
**edit: the charging guide for hte battery I chose is saying I can just use a regulator, resistor, and diode. might put it on the ring after all
***depending on space constraints and efficiency, may opt for a pmic again.
**stretch goal is to incorporate an energy harvest mechanism

!!mech

*cad a packaging




!done

*add a connector to interface with ring
**likely microusb (small enough?)
**functions
***programming
****might be able to program atblc via host mcu, so only need to be able to program host mcu
***charging

*choose some pins for pushbuttons
**assume only 4 buttons req rn
*determine interconnect for pushbuttons
**eg wires? another connector?

*programming
**(edit: no need) for freeing up i2c to program max32660
***however, possibly leave tp for i2c in case they're needed (vias, so you can
solder headers?)
***likely need a usb to i2c interface chip
