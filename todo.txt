!!general

*may need to move pushbuttons to atbtlc because I need at least 2 pins for...?
**not sure why. i think it was programming, but now that's unclear


!!power

*add battery supervisor
**according to graph on datasheet of chosen battery (ML-621S), full capacity is exhausted at ~2.25V. choosing supervisor based on this.
**nanopower line of supervisors from maxim: 23 suffix is ideal (2.313V nom)
***actually, expensive. found a cheaper one thats smaller too, slightly more
power. tps3839g25

*likely create a battery charge circuit as a separate device (save package
space, should be rarely used if battery life is good)
**edit: the charging guide for hte battery I chose is saying I can just use a regulator, resistor, and diode. might put it on the ring after all
***depending on space constraints and efficiency, may opt for a pmic again.
**stretch goal is to incorporate an energy harvest mechanism

!!mech

*cad a packaging




!done

*add a connector to interface with ring
**likely microusb (small enough?)
**functions
***programming
****might be able to program atblc via host mcu, so only need to be able to program host mcu
***charging

*choose some pins for pushbuttons
**assume only 4 buttons req rn
*determine interconnect for pushbuttons
**eg wires? another connector?
